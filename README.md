After watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!
